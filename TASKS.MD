## Project Tasks

### To-Do
[ ] Implement data reutilization with cache memory priorizing similar job execution.
[ ] Evaluate if reutilization of data with cache could be integrated with scheduler for priorizing proccess and data sharing on cache.

### In Progress
[ ] - Implementation of LRU as cache scheduler.
    [ ] - CACHE.cpp implemented and compiling.
    [ ] - CACHE.h implemented and compiling.
    [ ] - Cache loading intead of memory loading.
    [ ] - Cache management with LRU.
    [ ] - Cache and memory intercalation.
### Completed
- [x] Core instantiation following the draws.
- [x] Pipeline implemented as core method.
- [x] Different ASM's generated.
- [x] Different ASM's testing.
- [x] Implement thread initialization on each core.
- [x] Implement FCFS scheduler.
- [x] Implement SJF scheduler.
- [x] Implement RR scheduler.
- [x] Implement alternate between schedulers.
